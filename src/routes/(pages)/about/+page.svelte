      Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuleka-prah-phd-55b22115a/" target="_blank" class="underline">Tuleka!</a> Thanks for stopping by 🙂 Below is a brief backstory and explainer about what all this is about.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-left">
      <strong>Triggers & motivation</strong>: Prior to my recent role as a full-time employee at a startup, I’d been a freelancer in the creative industries for over 11 years. Those were some of the most rewarding and dynamic years of my employed life – I worked on so many interesting projects with lots of fascinating people and teams. In that time, tho, I also experienced a lot of stress and anxiety, stemming mainly from a couple recurring issues. I never really wanted to give up working as a freelancer, but those stressors eventually became a bit too much to bear.

    <p class="mb-8 text-left">
      Then a few months ago, whilst on parental leave, I found myself reflecting on potentially returning to freelancing. When I did, I felt all the anxieties creeping up again, which got me wondering about how I could instead affect positive change in the employment model that gave me so much happiness and freedom. I’m better-placed to do so nowadays because I can make full use of the combined skills, expertise and experience from my roles in the startup, with those from freelancing. I can put tried and tested strategic and leadership experience from taking projects and products from ideation to iteration, into developing and growing this proposed service. I’m energized by the challenge, and can’t think of a better way of directing my skills and expertise.
